<h1><p>Places I've Been</p></h1>


<h2>Colorado</h2>

<p>Going to Colorado was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had -- pun intended. I went in March, when it was 
   still <i>freezing</i> cold. There was snow everywhere, and it was actually the first time I've seen snow.
   Of course, the first thing I did was bury myself in it, and fall over constantly. My Floridian feet can't handle uneven ground.
   We went dog sledding, snow mobiling, hiking, sleigh riding... There wasn't a lack of things to do even in the frigid winter.</p>

<h2>Tennessee</h2>

<p>I think out of all the places I've been, Tennessee has to be one of my favorites. While not as high up as Colorado's mountains, eastern Tennessee was still just as breathtaking. 
    The place we went, Gatlinburg, was a hidden little town that you'd never realize was there. While not my favorite town, there was still a lot to do around it.
    We went river rafting, bear sight-seeing, went to a Native American reserve, ate pancakes (which were awesome) and explored the local wildlife. Bears are almost as 
    common as racoons here. You'll see them wandering the streets at night, hiding in trees or swimming in the local watering hole.</p>
