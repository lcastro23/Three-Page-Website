<h1><p>Tennessee - The Great Appalachian  Mountains</p></h1>

<p><b>Tennessee</b> is truly a place where you can get lost in nature. Having four seasons, it's far different than Florida.
      Tennessee is high up in the Appalachian mountains, where the temperature is cooler and rain clouds get trapped between the mountains, which you can see in the picture. 
      This means storms last longer here, sometimes for a week. It's a land of many colors -- during the spring and summer, the trees are green. 
      During the fall, the trees turn a golden orange color before their leaves fall in winter. Winter in Tennessee is beautiful -- every tree is coated in snow!
      The picture above depicts Tennessee just before fall is starting. Already the leaves are turning gold. As you can see, it has a wide variety of trees. From carniferous pines to oaks, maples and more!
      If you look closely you might even see an apple tree or two. The black bears love to hide in those. </p> 


  <blockquote>"We are famous for our three grand divisions of East, Middle and West Tennessee, represented by the three stars on our flag. 
    It is important however to remember that the blue circle around the three stars on our flag represents the unity of our state. 
    I believe that Tennesseans have much more that unites us than divides us." - Bill Lee </blockquote>
