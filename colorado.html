<p><b>Colorado</b> is usually a vast wasteland of snow, as you can see in the picture above. However, don't let the cold fool you. 
      It's still a very lively place even in the winter. The majority of Colorado is covered in pine trees, granite rock 
      and what I like to call redstone. Carved by glaciers and wind, Colorado's Rocky Mountains sit at an altitude of 14,000 feet! 
     Standing on one of the tallest peaks, you can see three whole states away and watch jumbo jets fly past.
     The streams of water you see in the picture are pretty common. As snow melts from the mountains, it forms little rivers
     that sneak around the mountains. A good place to see wildlife like moose, goats, rams, elk and big cats! Underneath all the snow
     is a ton of grass that usually stays golden brown through the rest of winter. But in the spring, it pops out as a nice green
     color with wildflowers. The lower altitude you go, the less likely you are to see snow.</p>


<blockquote>"The Rockies are therefore very young and should never be thought of as ancient. 
  They are still in the process of building and eroding, and no one today can 
  calculate what they will look like ten million years from now. They have the extravagant beauty of youth, 
  the allure of adolescence, and they are mountains to be loved."

  - James A. Michener.</blockquote>
